Terminal error

I need more information to properly fix this error. The "CommandError: Interactive prompt was cancelled" error indicates that a command requiring user input was interrupted, but I don't have enough context about:

Which specific command was running when this error occurred
What interactive prompt was being displayed
The sequence of actions that led to this error
To help you resolve this issue, please provide:

The exact command that was running when the error occurred
Any prompts or questions that appeared before the cancellation
Whether this happened during dependency installation, project setup, or another operation
Once I have this information, I can create an artifact with the appropriate solution, such as:

Adding the correct flags to make commands non-interactive
Providing the proper responses to expected prompts
Modifying scripts to handle interactive scenarios automatically
Could you share these details so I can provide an accurate fix?
