Now you have several options to build your APK:

Option 1: EAS Build (Recommended - Cloud Build)
Install EAS CLI globally:


npm install -g @expo/cli eas-cli
Login to Expo:


npx expo login
Configure EAS:


eas build:configure
Build APK:

This will build your APK in the cloud and provide you with a download link.

Option 2: Local Build (Requires Android Studio)
Install Android Studio and set up Android SDK

Generate local build:


npx expo run:android --variant release
The APK will be generated in:


android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
Option 3: Expo Development Build
For testing with native features:


eas build --platform android --profile development
